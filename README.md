# Commands for practicing OpenCV(Python) based on ROS.

Note: This practice was conducted in an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and ROS(Robot Operating System) 1 Noetic environment.<br><br>

To set up the project, follow these steps:<br><br>

# 1. Install libraries related to 'OpenCV'
  ```shell
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
  or
  ```shell
  pip3 install opencv-python
  ```
  <br>
  
  ```shell
  pip install numpy
  ```
  <br><br>

# 2. Create a package for practicing OpenCV in the ROS Noetic environment
  ```shell
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  ```
  ```shell
  catkin_create_pkg opencv_test rospy std_msgs sensor_msgs cv_bridge
  ```
  <br><br>

# 3. Set up CV bridge for integrating OpenCV with the ROS environment
  ```shell
  cd opencv_test
  ```
  <br>

  Modify the 'CMakeLists.txt' file.
  ```shell

  ```
  Add the following commands to the file.

    ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}
  )
  ```
  <br>
  
  Modify the 'package.xml' file.
  ```shell
  gedit package.xml
  ```
  Add the following commands to the file.
  ```shell
  <build_depend>opencv</build_depend>
  <exec_depend>opencv</exec_depend>
  ```
<br><br>

  <br><br><br>

# 6. Perform OpenCV practice in the ROS environment
